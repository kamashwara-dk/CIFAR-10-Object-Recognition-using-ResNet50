üåü CIFAR-10 Object Recognition using ResNet50
This repository contains the code and resources for an image classification project that tackles the CIFAR-10 dataset using a powerful deep learning model, ResNet50. The project leverages transfer learning from a pre-trained model to achieve high classification accuracy on a challenging computer vision task.

üìù Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of its 10 predefined categories. The main approach is to utilize the ResNet50 architecture, which is known for its effectiveness in deep image recognition tasks.

üß† Key Concepts & Techniques
CIFAR-10 Dataset: A standard benchmark dataset in computer vision, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).

ResNet50 Architecture: A Residual Network model with 50 layers. Its key innovation is the use of "skip connections" that allow for the training of very deep networks without performance degradation.

Transfer Learning: Instead of training from scratch, we use a ResNet50 model pre-trained on the massive ImageNet dataset. This allows us to leverage the sophisticated feature-extraction capabilities of the model and significantly reduce training time and resource requirements.

Data Augmentation: To prevent overfitting and enhance the model's generalization capabilities, we apply various transformations to the training images, such as random horizontal flips and rotations.

Model Fine-Tuning: After training a new classification head on the ResNet50 model, we perform fine-tuning by unfreezing some of the later ResNet layers and retraining the entire network with a very low learning rate. This adapts the pre-trained features to the specifics of the CIFAR-10 data.
